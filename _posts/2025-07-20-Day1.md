Step 4: Create a blog post
Your home page is looking great! 🤠

📖 Theory: Jekyll blog posts and frontmatter
Jekyll uses specially named files and frontmatter to create blog posts. The files must be named _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md and must include title and date in the front matter.

Front matter is a yaml section at the top of your file that looks like this:

---
title: "Welcome to my blog"
date: 2025-05-15
---
Note

Learn more in the Jekyll frontmatter documentation.

⌨️ Activity: Create a blog post
1. Browse to the main branch.
2. Click the Add file dropdown menu and then on Create new file.
3. Name the file following the _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format.
4. Replace the YYYY-MM-DD with today's date, and change the title of your first blog post if you'd like.

> If you do edit the title, make sure there are hyphens (-) between your words.
> If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "Page build failed: Invalid post date".

5. Type the following content at the top of your blog post:
```
---
title: "YOUR-TITLE"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```
  i.Replace YOUR-TITLE with the title for your blog post.
  ii. Replace YYYY-MM-DD with today's date.
6. Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later.
7. Commit your changes to the main branch.
8. As you commit your changes Mona will prepare the next step in this exercise!
